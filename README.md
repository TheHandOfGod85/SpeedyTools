I am building this software following the Clean Architecture principles as follows:

1-Separation of concerns: The architecture should be divided into independent layers or modules, with each layer responsible for a specific set of concerns.

2-Dependency inversion principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; instead, both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; instead, details should depend on abstractions.

3-Dependency injection: Dependencies should be injected into a module from the outside, rather than being created inside the module itself.

4-Testability: The architecture should be designed to facilitate automated testing, with the ability to test each component in isolation.

5-Domain-driven design(Not fully implemented): The architecture should be designed around the business domain, with the domain logic at the center of the architecture.

6-Decoupling: The architecture should be designed to minimize coupling between components, allowing for greater flexibility and easier maintenance.

7-Single responsibility principle: Each component or module should have a single responsibility, with a clear and well-defined interface.

8-Open/closed principle: The architecture should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new features to be added without modifying existing code.

9-Separation of UI and business logic: The user interface should be separated from the business logic, with a clear separation of concerns.

10-Clean code: The architecture should be designed with the goal of producing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
